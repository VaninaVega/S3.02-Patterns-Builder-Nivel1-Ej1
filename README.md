# S3.02-Patterns-Builder-Nivel1-Ej1

## Summary: exercise description
In all exercises, create a Gradle project with a Main class that demonstrates the use of the pattern (with any invocations needed).

Builder
Develop a pizza order management system using the Builder design pattern in Java. The system should allow the creation of different types of pizzas with different size, dough, and ingredient configurations.

Define a Pizza class with the following attributes:
size
dough
toppings

Create a PizzaBuilder interface with the methods needed to configure the size, dough, and ingredients of a pizza.
Implement one or more classes that act as specific builders (PizzaBuilder) for different types of pizzas. For example, you could have a builder for Hawaiian pizza, another for vegetarian pizza, and so on.
Develop a MestrePizzer class that receives a PizzaBuilder and allows you to build pizzas in a specific way.
In the main program (Main), create instances of PizzaBuilder and MestrePizzer, and use them to build pizzas with different configurations.
